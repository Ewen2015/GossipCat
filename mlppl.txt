machine learning pipeline:


part 1: business understanding & data engineering:

1. target defination
2. sample defination
3. time windows: sliding window / expending window
4. training data engineering


part 2: modeling modules: 

data -> 
1. preprocess           -> data 
2. feature engineering  -> data
3. tran test split      -> training data[1] & test data
4. modeling             -> training data[1]                      
                            -> cross validation     -> training data[2]
                                                    -> validation data      -> evaluation[1]  
                        -> model                             
5. testing              -> test data        3.2 test     -> evaluation[2]


part 3: deploy

1. data stortage
2. model trigger
3. mlops
